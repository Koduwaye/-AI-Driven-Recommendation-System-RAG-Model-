Problem Statement
Moving from Nigeria to the U.S. as an international student has been a challenging transition, especially when it comes to food. Beyond cultural differences, food serves as a deep connection to identity and heritage. However, access to traditional Nigerian meals is limited, and when available, ingredients are often expensive. This lack of accessibility creates a sense of cultural and emotional disconnect, making it difficult to enjoy familiar flavors from home.

Business Idea: TastyTreat
TastyTreat is a subscription-based service that delivers authentic, locally sourced meals and drinks from cultural chefs and producers directly to customers' doorsteps. This platform not only provides a taste of home for international communities but also supports local farmers, chefs, and food enthusiasts. By offering fresh, curated meals and snacks, TastyTreat brings convenience, authenticity, and a rich cultural experience to customers.

Business Solution
TastyTreat simplifies the process of accessing traditional meals by delivering ready-made dishes and ingredients, eliminating the need for extensive searching or preparation. Each delivery includes curated meals, cultural stories, and optional add-ons to help customers stay connected to their heritage or explore new culinary traditions.

Tech Integration: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
To enhance customer experience, TastyTreat will integrate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). This AI-driven system will improve data retrieval and generate relevant responses based on customer preferences, meal history, and dietary needs. By fine-tuning and customizing the RAG system, TastyTreat will provide a highly personalized, efficient, and engaging experience for users.
